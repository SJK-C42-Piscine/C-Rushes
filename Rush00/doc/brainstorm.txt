1. We've done corner casesL
1a. one char
1b. one row
1c. one column

2. Lets do general case:
for example:
/*******\
*       *
*       *
\*******/

2a. Lets make two loops
when we are in the corner, we print \ or /
when we are on the side (x==1 or x==n), y==1 or y==m, we print *
when we are inside, we print " "(space)

2b. Lets print first column:
/
*
*
\

after that we go to the second column and for the first and last char in row we put asterisk.
/*
*
*
\*

we make it till the last column, and for the last column we print specific column:
/********\
*        *
*        *
\********/

2c. Lets print first row:
/********\

after we print second row with only star at the beginning and end:
/********\
*        *

we do the same till the last row, and print the last row:
/********\
*        *
*        *
\********/

2d. Lets split our box into 3 parts: top line, bottom line and inner rows:
 - top line: "/" + "**********" + "\"
 - bottom line: "\" + "********" + "/"
 - inner row: "*" + "         " + "*"
 - all the rows have similarity: they have same number of columns, they just differ what is the first char, last char and internal char.
 - so if we define function(left char, inner char, right char), we should use it for all the lines.
